# inMarket

The service grew from a group founded by local students in response to a price hike in shops and hypermarkets whose rigid pricing policy is based on algorithms.


inMarket provides peer-to-peer technology that allows buyers and private sellers to directly negotiate all the details:

assortment, weight and price.

p.s.

you can also extend our application in different industries such as: 
1. Buliding & Construction - e.x. hiring people in the summer should be less expensive than in the winter. So you can bid the price w/priceHunter;
2. Auto & Moto - simply bid the price as far you and your vendor wants;
